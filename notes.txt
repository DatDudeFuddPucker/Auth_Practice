JWT Notes:


Purpose of Roles DB
We are going to have a protected data.
We need to have for example admin users to help moderate and maintain the DB.
Both on Data and user behavior.

"passwordIsValid" - what does it do/return?
it returns a  - 


// 'user.controller.js' file
 //-------------------> Purpose of this page?????
    - This is simply how we are oging ot test our data. 
    - This will help us find out that our data is actually protected. 
//--------------------> Why We dont use 'Next()' on this file. 
- The first three exports on this page are our routes. 
- This is not a middleware. We typically use 'Next" only in middleware to keep the processes going.
- We dont use 'next' here because we are not calling any functions where there might be a pause in data or code that might 
    - bring the process to a halt.
